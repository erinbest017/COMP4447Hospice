# Mapping Hospice Care Access in Colorado
### A County-Level Analysis Using Sociodemographic Indicators and Alzheimer’s and Dementia Prevalence

Research Questions:
- How do community characteristics, as captured by the American Community Survey (ACS) data, correlate with the presence and density of hospice providers across the state of Colorado?
- Can we identify gaps in hospice care access across Colorado by analyzing Alzheimer's disease prevalence and county-level demographic indicators?

## Description

This project explores disparities in hospice care access across Colorado using a blend of sociodemographic data and Alzheimer’s/dementia prevalence. We geospatially map hospice provider density and analyze trends based on:
- Age distribution
- Educational attainment
- Household and marital composition
- Alzheimer’s and Dementia prevalence in adults aged 65+

Our goal is to visualize and better understand geographic gaps in end-of-life care services.

## Data Sources
**American Community Survey (ACS)**
- Source: U.S. Census Bureau  
- Key features: Income, education, poverty level, age, and household composition

**National Provider Identifier (NPI) Registry**
- Public directory of active U.S. healthcare providers  
- Filtered for active hospice providers in Colorado

**Other datasets**
- Alzheimer's and Dementia prevalence (65+) in Colorado by county
- Colorado county boundary GeoJSON
