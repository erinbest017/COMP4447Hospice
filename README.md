# Mapping Hospice Care Access in Colorado: A County-Level Analysis Using Sociodemographic Indicators and Alzheimer’s Prevalence

Research Questions:
- How do community characteristics, as captured by the American Community Survey (ACS) data, correlate with the presence and density of hospice providers across the state of Colorado?
- Can we identify gaps in hospice care access across Colorado by analyzing Alzheimer's disease prevalence and county-level demographic indicators?

## Description

In addition to hospice provider count, our data includes key sociodemographic indicators and medical conditions like:
- Age, education, income, poverty, marital status, and household composition
- Alzheimer’s and Dementia prevalence

## Data Sources
American Community Survey (ACS)
- On-going survey from United States Census Bureau 
- Collects data on the social, economic, housing, and demographic characteristics of the U.S. population
- Our focus includes household income, educational attainment, householder/marital/civilian status, poverty level, and age

National Provider Identifier (NPI) Registry
- Free, public directory
- Contains active provider information based on the 10-digit unique NPI
- We pulled information for active hospice organizations based in CO

Other datasets include:
- Alzheimer's rates, Colorado County Boundaries
