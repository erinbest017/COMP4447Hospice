# Mapping Hospice Care Access in Colorado: A County-Level Analysis Using Sociodemographic Indicators and Alzheimer’s Prevalence

Research Questions:
- How do community characteristics, as captured by the American Community Survey (ACS) data, correlate with the presence and density of hospice providers across the state of Colorado?
- Can we identify gaps in hospice care access across Colorado by analyzing Alzheimer's disease prevalence and county-level demographic indicators?
